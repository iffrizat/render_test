# Rendering test

## What is this?
My attempt to understand and implement a decent (maybe a little bit retro) software rasterizer. Its only goal is to render a spinning textured model, very simple.

## Why in JS?
Becase the web has this nice canvas API, that abstracts the drawing away nicely, letting me focus on the math and rasterizing itself.

## TODO:
- Transformation pipeline (model -> world -> camera -> viewport -> projection)
- Load in a model (start with simple .objs or maybe something even simpler) 
- Render a model in wireframe
- Hidden-surface determination (with a Z-buffer probably)
- Textures & lighting
